# Aligned-Genomic-Sequence-Comparison
Originally built to compare SARS CoV-2 genetic sequences. 
It takes two aligned sequences and compares them, notates where mutations occured 
Can be altered for any other sequences including AA sequences.
Note: Sequences must have the same number of characters - str1 is the original string if str2 is longer, you must ensure the additional spaces get added into str1.
